                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>There is a cross platform team under Content Distribution under Carmen Palmer and they do the research to find how many stations are out there and which stations need to be onboarded and launched and they work directly with GMO.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>Every single one of the deals teams manages a certain partner. Thus, a user may need to filter through partners.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>Contract negotiations and rights changes happen once or twice each quarter only.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>Blacklisting is when we and the station are at an impasse with negotiations. Whitelisting is essentially when the station is good to go and the agreement is signed.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>Currently, there are multiple spreadsheets being used by the Affiliates team, Content Management, and GMO to manage the retrans rights and stations.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><p>NBC Retrans Rights spreadsheet</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><p>Columns A-D (in order from left to right): Call Sign, RETRANS-BLACKLIST, Update Date, GMO Confirmed</p></li>
                              <li><p>Content Management updates columns: RETRANS-BLACKLIST and Update Date</p></li>
                              <li><p>GMO controls the GMO Confirmed column</p></li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li><p>GCP Affiliate Rights spreadsheet</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><p>This spreadsheet shows everyone who has rights to what station. The NBC Retrans Rights spreadsheet is more for if there are any changes currently in that station, then we would update in here.</p></li>
                              <li><p>Columns A-G (in order from left to right): CALL SIGN (in Launch Priority Order), Partner-BLACKLIST, Request Date, GMO STATUS, Distribution Update, Additional Distribution Update, GMO Update Date.</p></li>
                              <li><p>The GDP Affiliate Rights sheet was created previously as something to be utilized but they condensed it down based off of the different agreements. The sheet used by Jonathan’s team and is the best to choose for this project is the NBC Retrans Rights spreadsheet.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>The Affiliates group gives Content Management all the information regarding all our stations and the rights and disputes or contracts with the various parent companies. They own that relationship.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>GMO owns the actual stream feeds and deals with the actual delivery of those items.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>Some stations fall under a parent company; for example, there could be over 100 stations with 7 parent companies.</p>
                      </li>

                    </ul>
                  </div>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>It makes sense to Jonathan to name the station rights and entitlements “Retrans Rights”. It is important to drive home that Retrans Rights is operational-based.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>From a production perspective, a staging level environment could be used for testing something new on the stream without affecting production. However, we should figure out if it may be something needed for other purposes in the future before deciding if there needs to be a staging environment.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>User permissions may need to be set up if the current station rights management workflow was expedited and automated.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><p>An example is if the Affiliates team goes in the system and enters the retrans rights. Content Management will look at it and approve or not. If the dispute is approved, the system will automatically do the switch. This may require different users to go into MVPD Admin and have the ability to only edit certain fields.</p></li>
